# My Shopping List

# Purpose 
To help enhance a user's shopping experience by allowing them to find the cost of the items they need at the Walmart nearest to their location. When a shopper searches for an item, they can add the item to their shopping list. When the shopper enters the city they are located in, they are presented with the nearest 5 walmart locations. When the shopper adds an item to their shopping list, the price is displayed to the right, and each time a new item is added to the list, the price is added and adjusted to the total at the bottom of the page. When the shopper reloads the page, all the information inputs remain.
